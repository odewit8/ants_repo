# ants_repo
Ant_Model contains the Julia files for the finite volume simulations for the PDE. 
We have added Jupyter Notebooks for how we created Figures 3, 4 (Ant_Model/src/type_fig3ab_4.ipynb) and how to do a type of Figure as in Figures 6 and 7 (Ant_Model/src/type_fig6_7_8.ipynb) in the paper.

FEM_lanes contains the Python files for the finite element scheme in Fenics for stationary solutions of lanes.
We have added a Jupyter Notebook for the code that generates Figure 13 (FEM_lanes/fem_lanes.ipynb).

SDE_particle contains the files for the particle simulations.
We have added a Jupyter Notebook for the code that generates Figure 2 (SDE_particle/particle_curves.ipynb).
