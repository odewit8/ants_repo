Ant_Model contains the files for the finite volume simulations for the PDE. 
We have added Jupyter Notebooks for how we created Figures 3, 4 and how to do a type of Figure as in Figures 6 and 7.

FEM_lanes contains the files for the finite element scheme for stationary solutions of lanes.

SDE_particle contains the files for the particle simulations.
