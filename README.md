# ants_repo
Ant_Model contains the Julia files for the finite volume simulations for the PDE. 
We have added Jupyter Notebooks for how we created Figures 3, 4 and how to do a type of Figure as in Figures 6 and 7 in the paper.

FEM_lanes contains the Python files for the finite element scheme in Fenics for stationary solutions of lanes.
We have added a Jupyter Notebook for the code that generates Figure 13.

SDE_particle contains the files for the particle simulations.
We have added a Jupyter Notebook for the code that generates Figure 2.
